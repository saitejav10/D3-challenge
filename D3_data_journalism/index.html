            Welcome to the newsroom! You've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. You're tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings. The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

          <p>The visualization above displays a positive correlation between poverty and lack of healthcare.
            There is a visible trend that suggests that the states with high percentage of poverty tends to lack healthcare than the states with little to no poverty. 
            Mississippi and New Mexico ranks highest in terms of Poverty while Texas and Georgia rank highest in terms of lack of healthcare.  
            The overall trend is not set in stone as there are some very clear outliers withing the chart. For example, there are states such as New Hampshiere with relatively low poverty but have high percentage of lack of healthcare compared to
            states such as Kentucky and Washignton D.C who have very high rate of poverty. </p>
